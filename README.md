# Restaurant-Management-System-
Olive and Bread is a local restaurant and I build a restaurant management system to help simplify the role of the manager/administrator. 
All orders could be tracked through an autoincremrnting order id, new items could be bought, new items could be added to the food/beverage menu, admin would be alerted when running low on a certain item etc. I even built an employee management system within the restaurant management system.
